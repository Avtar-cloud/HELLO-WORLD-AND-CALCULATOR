ðŸ’» "HELLO-WORLD" & "SIMPLE CALCULATOR"

ðŸŽ¯ Aim

a) To display "Hello World" on the console.
b) To develop a basic calculator for arithmetic operations.

ðŸ“š Theory

C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language derived from C. Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs, it supports object-oriented programming and is widely used for developing cross-platform applications.
This experiment includes two practical tasks: printing "Hello World" and building a simple calculator program.

ðŸ§© Part a) "Hello World"

The cout function from the iostream library is used to print output to the console. This library is part of the C++ Standard Library and provides essential input/output functionalities.
The directive using namespace std; simplifies code by removing the need to prefix standard functions with std::

ðŸ§® Part b) "Simple Calculator"

The calculator program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (âˆ’), multiplication (Ã—), and division (Ã·).
User input is captured using the cin function and stored in variables for computation. Control flow and operator logic are applied to execute the desired operation based on user choice.

ðŸ§  Conclusion

These foundational programs introduce core C++ syntax and logic in a hands on way. "Hello World" marks the entry point into console based applications, while the calculator exemplifies user interaction, arithmetic processing, and control flow. Together, they build a strong starting point for deeper programming exploration.ðŸš€
